Hi! Iâ€™m currently working on creating an online presence along with my studies :) Iâ€™m learning the basics of web development!

Let's connect. I'm always willing to exchange experiences and ideas. My interests in coding are both in Web and Gaming, so I'd neve decline helping in a game once I know more about programming!

I'm also a musician, and I dream about someday creating soundtracks for games. ğŸ˜„
